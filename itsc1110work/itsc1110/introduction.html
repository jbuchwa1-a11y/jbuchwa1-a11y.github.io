<p>Hello! My name is Jasmin Buchwald, and I am completing my last semester here at UNC-Charlotte. I am a middle child (the only girl). I will also be the first in my family to receive a Bachelor’s degree.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I was born and raised in Charlotte, NC. I loved it here so much that I decided to stay for my degree! My last name is German and it actually comes from my step-dad (pronounced Buck-wald).</li>
    <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I worked in the hospitality industry for over three years. I spent two years working at a restaurant, where I held the positions of Hostess, Hostess Trainer, Server (I had turned 18), and Server Trainer. I also worked with the restaurant's home office to alter and improve the standardized training process used across the corporation. I then began working for a racecar company, where I served as the Hospitality Manager for a year. I was responsible for our clients' gear, keeping an inventory of every hospitality item in the workshop and trailers, and ensuring the trailers were ready for races. For a short time, I also assisted one of the co-owners with the Event Itineraries, which consisted of a day-by-day breakdown of personnel, flights, rental cars, hotels, and all expenses associated with the event. I had the opportunity to complete an internship with Bank of America on the Enterprise Credit Healthcare team this past summer, and I have accepted a return offer.</li>
    <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> After three years, I graduated from Mallard Creek High School. I am a Senior and will be graduating this December. I am completing a B.S. in Economics with a concentration in Business Administration and minors in both Spanish and Operations &amp; Supply Chain Management.</li>
    <li><strong>Primary Computer:</strong> Apple MacBook Air laptop, macOS 14.6.1. I primarily work in my dining room.</li>
    <li><strong>Courses I’m Taking & Why:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>ECON4200 - Senior Seminar:</strong> It is a required course for my major.</li>
            <li><strong>ECON4141 - Health Economics:</strong> This is the last elective to meet the requirement for my major.</li>
            <li><strong>INFO3130 - Management Info Systems:</strong> I needed an extra course to meet my 120 credit hours. I enjoyed INFO2130, so I decided to continue with this course.</li>
            <li><strong>ITSC1110 - Intro to CS Principles:</strong> I needed one more course to hit 120 required hours. I thought this course sounded interesting and I have always wanted to learn more about Computer Science!</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember Me by:</strong>I danced and played both Varsity Soccer and Tennis in high school! I occasionally pick up my racket now, but I have recently taken a liking to Pickleball.</li>
